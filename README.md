# Voikko Language Server

Language server for [Voikko](https://voikko.puimula.org/).

## Features

- Checks spelling and grammar on txt and LaTeX files

## Requirements

### Voikko native library

You will need to have the native Voikko library installed.
It should be available through most package managers.

### Dictionary files

I recommend installing at least the standard dictionary
from [here](https://www.puimula.org/htp/testing/voikko-snapshot-v5/).

## TODO

- [ ] Quick actions
- [ ] Markdown files
- [ ] Neovim plugin
- [ ] Do incremental changes instead of full (maybe)
- [ ] GitHub Actions for release
